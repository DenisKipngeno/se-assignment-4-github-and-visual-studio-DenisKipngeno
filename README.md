# Branching and Merging in GitHub: What are branches in GitHub, and why are they important? Describe the process of creating a branch, making changes, and merging it back into the main branch.
### Branches are isolated lines of development within a repository. They allow developers to work on features, fixes, or experiments independently from the main codebase.
## *Creating a Branch:*
#### i) Clone Repository: Clone the repository to your local machine.
#### ii) Create Branch: Use git branch <branch-name> to create a new branch.
#### iii) Switch Branch: Use git checkout <branch-name> to switch to the new branch.
## *Making Changes and Merging:*
#### i) Make Changes: Commit changes to the new branch.
#### ii) Push Branch: Push the branch to GitHub using git push origin <branch-name>.
#### iii) Create Pull Request: Open a pull request on GitHub to merge the branch into the main branch.
#### iv) Review and Merge: After code review, merge the pull request to integrate changes into the main branch.

# Pull Requests and Code Reviews: What is a pull request in GitHub, and how does it facilitate code reviews and collaboration? Outline the steps to create and review a pull request.
### A pull request (PR) is a method of submitting contributions to a project. It allows developers to review, discuss, and merge code changes.
## *Steps to Create a Pull Request:*
#### i) Push Branch: Push your feature branch to GitHub.
#### ii) Open PR: Navigate to the repository on GitHub, click "Pull requests," then "New pull request."
#### iii) Compare Changes: Select the branch with your changes and the target branch.
#### iv) Submit PR: Add a title and description, then submit the pull request.
## *Reviewing a Pull Request:*
#### i) Open PR: Go to the "Pull requests" section of the repository.
#### ii) Review Changes: Review the code changes, add comments, and discuss with the author.
#### iii) Approve or Request Changes: Approve the PR or request changes.
#### iv) Merge PR: Once approved, merge the pull request.

# GitHub Actions: Explain what GitHub Actions are and how they can be used to automate workflows. Provide an example of a simple CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.
### GitHub Actions is a CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) platform that automates workflows.
## *Example of a CI/CD Pipeline:*
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: '14'

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm install
